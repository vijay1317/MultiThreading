thread within a given PROCESS share the same memory space, which is both a positive and negative.It enable threads to share
data, which can be valuable. However,it also creates the opportunity for issue when two threads modify a resource at the same time.
java provides the synchronization and the lock form the  basis for implementing synchronized execution of code.

    1) most commonly we restrict access to shared resource through the use of the synchronized keyword
        - it can be applied to:
            -> methods, code block
       * if two thread calls the  method of a class then:
            i) method  executed at same time by both thread if
                - both thread having different objects of class.
            ii) two thread could not simultaneously execute the  method if same object is passed then synchronization is required.
